I'm Jake. An [Open Source Enthusiast](/open-source-work), Blogger, Speaker, Microsoft MVP (VSTO) and a fan of good Beer & Whisky.

Currently I am a Consultant for [Adaptive Consulting](http://weareadaptive.com) in London with a bunch of really cool people. Before that I was a Senior Consultant with [Readify](http://readify.net/), another top consulting company based in Perth, Australia.

It is worth checking out the [Adaptive Blog](http://blog.weareadaptive.com/), they are doing some really great stuff.
