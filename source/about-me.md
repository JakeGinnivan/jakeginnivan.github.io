I'm Jake. An [Open Source Enthusiast](/open-source-work), Blogger, Speaker, Microsoft MVP (VSTO) and a fan of good Beer & Whisky.

Currently I am working for [Adaptive Consulting](http://weareadaptive.com) at Deutsche Bank with a bunch of really cool people. Check out the [Adaptive Blog](http://blog.weareadaptive.com/), they are doing some really great stuff.
