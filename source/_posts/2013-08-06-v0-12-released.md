I have just pushed the button on VSTO Contrib v0.12!

This release is aimed at fixing a bunch of bugs, like some callbacks not working, creating a viewmodel instance for when no documents are open and supporting Office 2013!
Due to the complexities of supporting multiple versions, I have dropped Office 2007 support. Please let me know if this is a major issue, and I might try to add it back in next release.

I have also released a getting started video. This is one of the first screencasts I have done, so I will likely do it again next release. Also when you install VSTO Contrib, a readme will popup, this will help you get started.

I will try to produce some documentation/blog posts on VSTO Contrib over the next few weeks.

From now, I will be tracking changes/fixes a lot better. Please report any issues at [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/VSTOContrib/issues][1]
