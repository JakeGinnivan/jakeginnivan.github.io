While doing a large update to FunnelWeb, I was dogfooding. Unfortunately I forgot to update my blog when I pushed my updates up into the dev repository.

This resulted in my blog running a broken version which only ever existed in my local repository. Doh..

Anyways, have updated and all seems good. Hit me up on twitter (JakeGinnivan) if there are any other issues.
