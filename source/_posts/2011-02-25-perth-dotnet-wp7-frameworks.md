# Windows Phone 7 Frameworks

Windows phone 7 frameworks have been popping up quite rapidly, and I have found each has benefits and drawbacks. You may be asking questions like, do I need a framework? What will it give me over rolling my own?

In this session I will be giving an introduction to windows phone development, and they diving into a few key area's in windows phone development like lifecycle (tombstoning etc), navigation and general mvvm support.

You will leave knowing much more about Windows Phone 7 dev, and how to select the framework for your application
