! DEV304 - Adding Value to Software Projects with VSTO (Wed, 11:30am)
This sessions will have something for everyone, if you have never used VSTO and are interested in it, I will be showing the value it has.
If you have used it, and hated it, I will also be showing how to improve your experience and give you a way of approaching the problems and some nice ways to improve the default experience. Part of this is a quick intro to COM Interop, how it works and how to make sure you avoid problems with it.
And finally, I will be showing a bit of VSTO contrib and how you can use IoC and other cool enhancements to the platform.
