  I have been working on a MVC framework for Windows Phone 7 for a while. It is up on codeplex and it is slowly maturing.

---
I blogged a few weeks ago about the Windows Phone Essentials project, since then, I have started up the [http://windowsphonefoundations.net/](http://windowsphonefoundations.net/) website which is home to Windows Phone Essentials, Windows Phone MVC and Windows Phone MVP (and more projects in the future).

#Features
This will change over time, so check out the change log.

- Strongly Typed Navigation
- Custom Shell, Navigator and Journal to give better control over navigation of WP7
- TransitionFrame comes out of the box, for nice navigation animations
- Ability to pass arguments in navigation, rather than uri query strings
- Modal Dialog support
- Easy access to Obscured and Activated events on your view model
- Full Testable! All major WP7 classes (WindowsPhoneFrame, WindowsPhoneApplication etc) all have Interfaces and are wrapped to allow you to test
- Some helpers around Async. Execute.AsyncPattern or Execute.AsyncPatternWithResult synchronise async calls
- Task/Chooser support, in a testable way
- Convention based Controller and View discovery
- Autofac Support Via an Extension
- Easy access to page or application transient storage
- Simple tombstoning support

#Other cool stuff

## Nice small/clean app.xaml/app.xaml.cs

    <Application x:Class="HelloWindowsPhoneMVC.App"
                 xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                 xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                 xmlns:WindowsPhoneMVC="clr-namespace:WindowsPhoneMVC;assembly=WindowsPhoneMVC"
                 UnhandledException="ApplicationUnhandledException">

        <Application.ApplicationLifetimeObjects>
            <WindowsPhoneMVC:NavigationApplication DefaultController="SomeController" DefaultAction="Blah" />
        </Application.ApplicationLifetimeObjects>
    </Application>

## Type safe navigation
    //Simple ICommand creation
    ShowAboutDialogCommand = Controller<HomeController>().NavigationCommand(c => c.AboutDialog);
    ShowAboutDialogCommand = Controller<HomeController>().NavigationCommand(c => c.AboutDialog, "A parameter");

    //And normal navigation
    Controller<HomeController>().NavigateTo(c => c.AboutDialog)

    //And from xaml (not type safe)
    <Button commands:Navigate.To="Home.About" Content="About" />

## Easy lifecycle management

    public SomeViewModel()
    {
        Transient(() => Name); //Will be restored after tombstone
    }

Also have the `IObscuredAware` and `IActivationAware` to easily get notified about view activation/deactivation and when your app is obscured.

## Autofac support via extension
Simple add the NuGet package for Autofac support, then change in your `App.xaml` from `<WindowsPhoneMvc:NavigationApplication />` to `<AutofacIntegration:AutofacNavigationApplication />`

The NuGet package will create you a Autofac module to do all your registrations of services.

#Check it out
Head over to [http://windowsphonefoundations.net/windowsphonemvc](http://windowsphonefoundations.net/windowsphonemvc) or download via NuGet at
[http://nuget.org/List/Packages/WindowsPhoneMVC](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/WindowsPhoneMVC)

Feedback welcome! I think it makes WP7 development really enjoyable. 

Project templates on their way.
