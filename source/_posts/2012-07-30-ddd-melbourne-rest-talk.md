Over the weekend I presented at [http://www.dddmelbourne.com/](http://www.dddmelbourne.com/) on building RESTful web services.

I wanted to do it a bit different to the REST talks I had been to, and really try to cover how it all fits together, as well as the theory and covering the [Richardson Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) I put together a RESTful beer API, which I want to evolve over time as a cool example. My intention is to release WebApi.Hal as a NuGet package once it matures a little more and I figure out the API and conventions.

My slides are available **[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vksivsuo5fx44qp/REST.pptx)**

All the sample code is available in the WebApi.Hal project on github ([https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/WebApi.Hal](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/WebApi.Hal)) and I do accept pull requests. =)

The resource linker stuff is a bit clunky, but I think it is becoming quite a good example of a RESTful API. If you want to help out or have suggestions just fire me an email to jake at ginnivan dot net.
