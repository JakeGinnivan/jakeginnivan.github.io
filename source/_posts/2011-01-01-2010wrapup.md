  2010 was a big year for me, this is a bit of a rundown of what I have done

---
I am a few days late to post this, but oh well =)

2010 was an amazing year for me, I joined [Readify][1] in February and have been doing as learning and community work as I can. Last year I managed to present 6 times, and I hope to present more this year.

Presentations
-------------

 - April, [PerthDotNet][2] **VSTO in Visual Studio 2010**
 - May, [Alt.NET Melbourne][3] **TDD, Unit Testing and Mocking**
 - June, [MOSSIG][4] (Melbourne) **Developing Add-ins with VSTO**
 - August, [TechEd][5] (Gold Coast) **Developing with the VSTO Platform**
 - November, [CodeCampOz][6] (Wagga Wagga) **Extending Office with VSTO**
 - November, [SDDN][7] (Perth) **MahTweets for Windows Phone 7**

I also attended the [Microsoft Evangelism Academy][8] just before Christmas, which was a 3 day intense training course organised by Sarah Vaughn and Andrew Coates from Microsoft DPE with the goal of improving the presentation skills of 8 the lucky people that were selected. Read more about it [here][8].

Open Source Work
----------------

 - [VSTO Contrib][9] - Collection of libraries which make COM Interop much easier, and add IoC support to VSTO Add-ins (which making it easier to test).
 - [Fibre Async Framework][10] - Another Async framework, which runs on Silverlight and WP7 as well as .NET 3.5/4.0. It simply allows you to coordinate async work, or perform work asynchronously. Goals are similar to the Task parallel library in .NET 4.0, but has a simpler API, and works on more frameworks. I would like to think it has a lower barrier to entry than other frameworks due to it's simplicity.
 - [AutoMapper][11] - Added Inheritance to AutoMapper, made AutoMapper feel MUCH more predictable. My fork is available at [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/AutoMapper/][12] Hopefully the changes will be pulled into the Jimmy's repository soon =)
 - [MahTweets for Windows Phone][13] - Have done a lot on this project, lots of refactoring and cleanups mainly.
 - [FunnelWeb Blog][14]  -The blog engine that is behind my blog, started by [Paul Stovell][15] it is now an awesome open source blog engine based on MVC3.

This year
---------

This year I want to keep up my Open Source work, as well as do more presenting. One of the biggest fails this year is that I have been so busy and have stopped playing Inline Hockey, doing Rock n' Roll and also Ballroom dancing. I will start at least the dancing back up this year.

Look forward to catching up with all the people I have met this year!
