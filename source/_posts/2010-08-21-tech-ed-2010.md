I have been lucky enough to be selected to speak at TechEd this year, and it is only 2 days away!

The backend of my blog blew up a few weeks ago and have been trying to find the time to rebuild it, and I have managed to get it done while fine tuning my talk.

I will be speaking about how to use VSTO as a platform, it is a level 300 talk so expect a lot of code, demo's and hopefully you will be able to take a few things away. I am really looking forward to this talk and I think that people will be surprised at what you can achieve with VSTO if you know what path to take.

My talk is DEV332 at 8.15 am Thursday morning in Meeting Room 8.
