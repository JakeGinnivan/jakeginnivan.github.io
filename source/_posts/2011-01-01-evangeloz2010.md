  Just before Christmas I was lucky enough to addend the inaugural MS Evangelism Academy with 7 others to take our presentations to the next level.

I am a little late blogging about this, by last month I attended the inaugural Microsoft Evangelism Academy ([#EvangelOz][1]) which was organised by Andrew Coates ([@coatsy][2]) and Sarah Vaughan ([@sarahvaughan][3]) at Microsoft DPE. The goal of this program is to take 8 of us to the next level with our presenting! It started with 3 days of coaching, it will continue until August 2011 and will include:

 - Monthly conference calls
 - Monthly 1 on 1 catchup over the phone with a mentor
 - 1 day of group training in Melbourne every 2-3 months
 - Talk at UserGroups, Conferences and whatever we can!

I was lucky enough to attend with: 

- [James Bannan][4] ([@JamesBannan][5])
 - Windows Desktop Experience MVP
- [Steven Nagy][6] ([@snagy][7])
 - Windows Azure MVP
- [John Oâ€™Brien][8] ([@soulsolutions][9])
 - Windows Live MVP
- [Jeremy Thake][10] ([@jthake][11])
 - SharePoint MVP
- [Chris Walsh][12] ([@ChrisWalshie][13])
 - Windows Phone 7 guru
- [Bronwen Zande][14] ([@BronwenZ][15])
 - Windows Live MVP
- [Mark Rhodes][16] ([@MRhodes][17])
 - SharePoint Infrastructure guru

Over the three days I made some new friends, and learnt a lot about the art of presenting. We covered many areas including Motion, Gestures, Eye Contact, Voice, Stance, Visuals, Content and much more.

I found the whole exercise quite challenging and have to say thanks to  Steve Herzberg ([@nrgsteve][18]) and Melony Dos Remedios from NRG Solutions. They were great mentors, and I look forward to catching up with them again in February!

Hopefully I will post some video's/pictures of the course over the few weeks, but in the meantime you can have a look at any of the others blog posts about EvangelOz =)
