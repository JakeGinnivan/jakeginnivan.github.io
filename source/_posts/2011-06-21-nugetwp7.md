  NuGet 1.4 has just come out, as has the mango tools. 1.4 breaks existing targets, here is my solution

**Update** Compatibility table at [http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package#Common_Framework_and_Profile_Targeting_Examples](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package#Common_Framework_and_Profile_Targeting_Examples)

I released windows phone essentials last week, and I have the mango tools installed, so all seemed fine. Then when a friend of mine tried to install the package they got the following error:

    Unable to find assembly references that are compatible with the target framework 'Silverlight,Version=v4.0,Profile=WindowsPhone'

Hrrm that blows. As you may be aware, Windows Phone 7 runs a version of silverlight known as Silverlight 3.7. NuGet recommends that you use the lib\SL3-WP for windows phone projects, but if you install the mango tools, this will change to SL4-WP. On top of that if you create a project targeting mango specifically you need to put your library into SL4-WindowsPhone71. It seems that NuGet 1.4 will replace WP with WindowsPhone, but I am not sure about previous versions.

My workaround at the moment is to just specify all of them until there is some official documentation:
 
    lib\SL3-WP\WindowsPhoneEssentials.dll
    lib\SL4-WindowsPhone71\WindowsPhoneEssentials.dll
    lib\SL4-WindowsPhone\WindowsPhoneEssentials.dll
