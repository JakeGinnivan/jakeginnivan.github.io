At the MVP summit last year I picked up a [Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop pack](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/p/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop), mainly because I cannot stand the UK keyboard layout and wanted to stay on the US layout while working in London.

I just had a very strange issue, I could not type a capital **V**, lowercase worked fine. Plugging into another machine showed the same issue.

One of the problems with the Sculpt is that the function keys get stuck. Apparently if the `F5` key gets stuck, then you can no longer type a capital V. If the `F2` key is stuck then you won't be able to type a capital C. 

If you hit this random issue, hopefully you will read this post before returning your keyboard.
