I love open source, and contribute a lot of my free time to working on open source. You can find me on [Codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/JakeGinnivan), [GitHub](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/JakeGinnivan)

If you want to get started with Open Source, I am happy to help, just email me or hit me up on twitter. 

## Why?
I got into open source to try and learn more, I felt I did not know enough and work does not give you the luxury of re-writing things and getting good feedback in the open. It was pretty scary to get started. But once involved I was hooked!

I encourage you to give contributing to open source a try, we have a long way to go in the .NET space for open source and I hope that my contributions are making .NET open source a better place to be.

My open source related blog posts are [here](/blog/categories/open-source).

## Projects
### My Projects
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/GitReleaseNotes](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/GitReleaseNotes) - Generate release notes easily from your Git repo
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/ApiApprover](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/ApiApprover) - Uses ApprovalTests to approve the public API of your library to help notify you when you have possibly introduced a breaking change which would require a major SemVer bump
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/WebApi.Hal](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/WebApi.Hal) - A WebAPI media type formatter which allows you to easily support hypermedia via HAL
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/SettingsProvider.net](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/SettingsProvider.net) - Simple library which makes saving/restoring settings really easy
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/VSTOContrib](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/VSTOContrib) - Enables convention over configuration, testability, IoC and a HEAP of other things in your VSTO add-in making VSTO add-ins **much** nicer to develop
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/VSTest.TeamCityLogger](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/VSTest.TeamCityLogger) - If you use VSTest to run your tests, this is an extension which will expose the test results to teamcity.
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/UIAComWrapper](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/UIAComWrapper) - Used by TestStack.White, this wraps the new COM UIA v3 libraries easing much of the migration pain between v2 and v3 of UIA. This project is a fork of a project off codeplex which is no longer maintained
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/TfsBuildResultPublisher](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/TfsBuildResultPublisher) - Allows you to publish a 'fake' build into TFS with test results. Useful to use TeamCity, then push the results into TFS for reporting reasons
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/UITextBlock](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/UITextBlock) - An enhanced WPF text block which is visible to UI automation and a bunch of other nice enhancements
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/XText](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/XText) - A XDocument style api to generate a WPF flow doc
 - [https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/XamlAttributeOrderingCodeCleanup](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/XamlAttributeOrderingCodeCleanup) - ReSharper plugin to order xaml attributes when doing a code cleanup

### TestStack

 - [https://github.com/TestStack/TestStack.BDDfy](https://github.com/TestStack/TestStack.BDDfy) - The simples BDDfy framework around

There are a few other small projects. small contributions to other projects and projects I no longer maintain. I hope this inspires you to get involved, much of this is done out of need. I need to solve a problem I have, if there is not a library already which I can just enhance then I can create my own.
