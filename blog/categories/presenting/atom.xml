    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend I presented at <a href="http://www.dddmelbourne.com/">http://www.dddmelbourne.com/</a> on building RESTful web services.</p>

<p>I wanted to do it a bit different to the REST talks I had been to, and really try to cover how it all fits together, as well as the theory and covering the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">Richardson Maturity Model</a> I put together a RESTful beer API, which I want to evolve over time as a cool example. My intention is to release WebApi.Hal as a NuGet package once it matures a little more and I figure out the API and conventions.</p>

<p>My slides are available <strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vksivsuo5fx44qp/REST.pptx">here</a></strong></p>

<p>All the sample code is available in the WebApi.Hal project on github (<a href="https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/WebApi.Hal">https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/WebApi.Hal</a>) and I do accept pull requests. =)</p>

<p>The resource linker stuff is a bit clunky, but I think it is becoming quite a good example of a RESTful API. If you want to help out or have suggestions just fire me an email to jake at ginnivan dot net.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Rich Client UI Automation, without shooting yourself in the foot</h1>

<p>When you talk to most people that have tried Coded UI Tests or other UI Automation they tell you it was great, then it caused them way too much pain to be worth it. This phenomenon is also known as the Sine of Death by UI Test Automation. In this session Jake will show you how to avoid the Sine of Death and make UI Automation an invaluable part of your testing with a great ROI which reducing risk in the project.</p>

<p>After watching this session you will talk away knowing how UI Automation works, what each of the Frameworks (White, Coded UI) give you, and the techniques you can apply to succeed with UI Automation. These techniques are used in production right now and you will see a demo of that applications test suite.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>I will post resources on Rich Client Automation after my talk, or early next week.</p>

<p>Windows phone 7 frameworks have been popping up quite rapidly, and I have found each has benefits and drawbacks. You may be asking questions like, do I need a framework? What will it give me over rolling my own?</p>

    <id>http://jake.ginnivan.net/evangeloz2010</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a little late blogging about this, by last month I attended the inaugural Microsoft Evangelism Academy (<a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23EvangelOz">#EvangelOz</a>) which was organised by Andrew Coates (<a href="http://twitter.com/coatsy">@coatsy</a>) and Sarah Vaughan (<a href="http://twitter.com/sarahvaughan">@sarahvaughan</a>) at Microsoft DPE. The goal of this program is to take 8 of us to the next level with our presenting! It started with 3 days of coaching, it will continue until August 2011 and will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monthly conference calls</li>
<li>Monthly 1 on 1 catchup over the phone with a mentor</li>
<li>1 day of group training in Melbourne every 2-3 months</li>
<li>Talk at UserGroups, Conferences and whatever we can!</li>
</ul>


<p>I was lucky enough to attend with:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://demonictalkingskull.com/">James Bannan</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/jamesbannan">@JamesBannan</a>)</li>

<li><a href="http://mrhodes.net/">Mark Rhodes</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/MRhodes">@MRhodes</a>)</li>
<li>SharePoint Infrastructure guru</li>
</ul>


<p>Over the three days I made some new friends, and learnt a lot about the art of presenting. We covered many areas including Motion, Gestures, Eye Contact, Voice, Stance, Visuals, Content and much more.</p>

<p>I found the whole exercise quite challenging and have to say thanks to  Steve Herzberg (<a href="http://twitter.com/nrgsteve">@nrgsteve</a>) and Melony Dos Remedios from NRG Solutions. They were great mentors, and I look forward to catching up with them again in February!</p>

<p>Hopefully I will post some video&rsquo;s/pictures of the course over the few weeks, but in the meantime you can have a look at any of the others blog posts about EvangelOz =)</p>
