    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been lucky enough to be selected to speak at TechEd this year, and it is only 2 days away!</p>

<p>The backend of my blog blew up a few weeks ago and have been trying to find the time to rebuild it, and I have managed to get it done while fine tuning my talk.</p>

<p>I will be speaking about how to use VSTO as a platform, it is a level 300 talk so expect a lot of code, demo&rsquo;s and hopefully you will be able to take a few things away. I am really looking forward to this talk and I think that people will be surprised at what you can achieve with VSTO if you know what path to take.</p>

<p>My talk is DEV332 at 8.15 am Thursday morning in Meeting Room 8.</p>
